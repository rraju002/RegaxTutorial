# Regex Tutorial

As a Full-Stack Web Developer I found it important to explain the specifics of regex to ensure we understand what the search patterns are within the regex!

## Summary

Regex stands for "regular expression," a sequence of characters which define a specified search pattern. Most patterns are used via string-search algorithims such as the "find" function.  

Moving forward we will be looking at the email validation regex or, </br> `\b[a-z0-9#$_-]+@[a-z0-9]+\.[a-z]{2,3}\b/gi`</br>

## Regex Components
Analyzing </br> `\b[a-z0-9#$_-]+@[a-z0-9]+\.[a-z]{2,3}\b/gi`</br> ...
- First lets start with defining some key terms... 
The Alpha and Omega can in short be considered the beginning and end which ends in '\b' also known as "word boundaries." Word boundaries explain expressions need to be partnered as a stand-alone string, for example closed parentesis, without seperating spaces their validation is likely to fail due to it's inability to match with another component.
- Considering the 1st group `[a-zA-Z0-9#$_-]+` ...
