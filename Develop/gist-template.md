# Regex Tutorial

As a Full-Stack Web Developer I found it important to explain the specifics of regex to ensure we understand what the search patterns are within the regex!

## Summary

Regex stands for "regular expression," a sequence of characters which define a specified search pattern. Most patterns are used via string-search algorithims such as the "find" function.  

Moving forward we will be looking at the email validation regex or, </br> `\b[a-z0-9#$_-]+@[a-z0-9]+\.[a-z]{2,3}\b/gi`</br>
